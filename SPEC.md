# Project Specifications
This website is meant to provide a way to browse the crime report statistics of Portland for the last 10 years.  It will be an improvement over current websites which only provide graphs as static images ([Portland State Crime Data](http://www.pdx.edu/crime-data/) and [Portland Crime Mapper](http://www.portlandmaps.com/maps/police/).  Although the data source will be the same (and a little more limited) it will provide usability improvements with the addition of being able to explore these statistics geographically (web map).

## Phase 1
The first phase will focus exclusively on showing the data in interactive graphs.  The interactive graphs created will allow users to do the following:
- Show the count of reported crime incidents by year and month
- Show the percent change in reported crime incidents by year and month

Additionally, users will have these filters available to them:
- Major Offense Type (crime)
- Neighborhood
- Police District
- Police Precinct

## Phase 2
The second phase of the project will be adding in the mapping components.  The map will allow users to explore this data by neighborhood in portland.  Clicking a nieghborhood will reveal any one of the graphs completed in phase 1.  A heatmap per incident type will also be added to give users another way to visualize the crime report statistics.

## Phase 3
Profit!
